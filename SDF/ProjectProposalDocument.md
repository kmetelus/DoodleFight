# 3.0 Project Proposal Document

### 3.1 Verbal Description
Doodle Fight is a 2D fighting game in which a player battles against another character controlled either by another player or by artificial intelligence (AI). In Doodle Fight, these characters are stick figures armed with a sword and a shield. In controlling this stick figure, the player will then attempt to defeat his opponents by executing combinations of various attacks. Repeated attacks will result in victory after their opponent's health bar is completely depleted or by sending their opponent flying off of the stage through a wall.

### 3.2 Justification
This game will pull from knowledge acquired from a multitude of classes including Data Structures, Algorithms, Game Design, Interaction Design, and Artificial Intelligence. Data Structures will help me keep a class structure in my game that is organized so that I am not needlessly reusing code. Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence are going to help tremendously with creating an AI for players to practice against on their own. Interaction Design will help me create a User Interface for the game that is intuitive and allows new players learn the games controls and mechanics with ease. Lastly, the knowledge I acquired from Game Design will help me make the game fair and balanced but also fun for the player.

Making a game is a lot of work and is typically done in as a team, however I know I am capable of completing one in the span of a semester on my own as I have done it before. The most challenging part of making the game will be generating hitboxes for the characters and getting an AI to work for single player. Using the experience I gained making an AI for my CMSI 401 project, "HeartWired", I am confident that I will be able to make a rudimentary AI for Doodle Fight.

After making games in both Unreal Engine 4 as well as Unity, I settled on using Unity for this project in particular. My experience with Unreal Engine 4 was riddled with massive commits that GitHub could not handle.  I believe Unity to be better suited to handling a project of this size.

I have played fighting games for most of my life, so getting the opportunity to not only create a game that I like, but also gaining experience in a field that I intend on pursuing a career in which is game development. For this reason, I believe it is in my interest to create a game for my 402 as it is relevant to my  career and personal interests.
