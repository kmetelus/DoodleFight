DoodleFight  Project SRS Evaluation
===================================

Nice job on this, a very good document.  The "definitions" section is
very helpful!

Some suggestions.

When thinking of requirements, try to be even more specific about what 
you are specifying.  For a project of this magnitude and intent, you need
a few more requirements, and a bit more detail.  Also, make sure that
each requirement ONLY specifies ONE thing.  For example, in requirement
5.3.1.2.1.2 you are specifying the player can defeat a character by doing
two things, coupled by an "OR"; this should be split into two requirements.

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
