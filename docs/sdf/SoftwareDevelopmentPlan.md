# 4.1   Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the *Doodle Fight* application, a 2D fighting game that users will be able to download and play on both Mac/PC. I will be breaking down the development into several chunks, completing each in a succession such that the next step builds on a previous one. I will be using a Windows PC computer and Unity throughout the development of the project.
