### Report 001 (02/19/18)
Due to complications that arose when trying to get prefabs made using 3D assets in Unity to interact with other prefabs that use 2D physics because by default they use 3D physics, I was forced to remake all of my prefabs using only 2D physics. After redoing all of that, I am moving on to generating hitboxes and working in a knockback feature.
